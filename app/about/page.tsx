              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                ScholarWrite was founded in 2015 by a group of educators and former students who recognized the growing
                challenges students face in today's demanding academic environment. We saw talented students struggling
                not because they lacked ability, but because they were overwhelmed by competing demands on their time.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                What started as a small team of dedicated writers has grown into a thriving community of over 800 expert
                writers and editors, serving more than 250,000 students worldwide. We've delivered over 1.5 million
                papers, maintaining a 98% satisfaction rate that we're incredibly proud of.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Today, ScholarWrite stands as a trusted partner for students seeking academic support. We're not just a
                writing serviceâ€”we're a community dedicated to helping students learn, grow, and succeed in their
                academic journey.
